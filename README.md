â€¢ Windows Store Application

Shopping Store in C# language using WPF.
The store supports all kinds of actions,
from customer to management operations.


As an admin in the store, you can manage all your orders, add or delete products,
update amount in stock etc.
As a buyer, you can add products to your cart, make new orders and track your last orders.
The application also has a simulator mode, that demonstrates the normal procedure of the store,
from receiving a new order to shipping it.


All you need is Visual Studio on your computer and you are ready to go!
We recommend starting with admin mode and then try to make a new order as a buyer.
After that feel free to enter simulator mode, 
the simulator window can stay open while you keep testing things.
Enjoy.
